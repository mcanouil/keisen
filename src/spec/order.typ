///! Resolution of directives that depend on the final shape of the table.
///!
///! Most directives record what they are told and are validated once at the
///! end. Column ordering could not: `columns-move` used to resolve its anchor
///! against the column list as it stood mid-fold, so hiding the anchor, or
///! promoting it into the stub, changed whether the move succeeded depending on
///! which line was written first. That contradicts the architecture's claim
///! that directive order is free.
///!
///! Ordering now happens here, once, after every directive has been recorded,
///! so a move sees the columns the table actually has.
