// This is the one predicate that decides whether a summary row is formatted at
// all, and it is asked three times: once for the metrics a column is padded to,
// once for the cell that padding is applied to, and once for substitutions. The
// first two disagreeing is what put summary cells outside their column's
// metrics, so they ask the same question here rather than each spelling it.
// A cell formatter reads the row it sits in, and a summary row is an aggregate
// with no row behind it, so it covers nothing here: the column falls back to
// whichever plain directive covers it, or to the aggregate itself.

// same way: `none`, an empty string, and `float.nan`. Testing against `none`
// alone made the empty string a value, which is the spelling a CSV or a JSON
// export writes, so a column of numbers with one gap in it stopped looking
// numeric and moved to the start edge. It also made a column of all `float.nan`
// look numeric, since nothing in it was `none`, so a column holding nothing sat
