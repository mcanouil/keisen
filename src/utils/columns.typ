///! The one reading of "this directive names a column that is not there".
///!
///! A column that exists but sits elsewhere is not an unknown column, and
///! saying so would send the reader hunting for a typo that is not there. So a
///! hidden column and a stub column are each named as what they are, and only a
///! name the table does not carry at all is reported as unknown.
///!
///! Written out at three call sites before this existed, and the three had
///! already drifted apart in wording. The order and the problem text are shared;
///! the hints are not, since what to do about a hidden column depends on what
///! the directive was trying to do with it.
