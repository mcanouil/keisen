// In-cell nanoplots drawn with native primitives, sharing one domain down the
// column so the sparklines can be compared. Cash must read as flat: scaled per
// cell, its small wobble would draw exactly like real movement.
//
// A plot is taller than the figures beside it, so this is the table where the
// theme's vertical placement shows. Nothing in the suite had ever set
// `cell-vertical-align`, and the option reaches `table.cell` through the
// renderer, which no assertion can read back. The render is the reader: with
// the option discarded, every short cell falls back to the top of its row,
// which is where Typst puts a table cell, and the tracked image goes stale.
